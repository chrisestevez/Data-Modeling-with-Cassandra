# Data Modeling with Cassandra

## Introduction

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You'll be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Project Description

I apply data modeling with Apache Cassandra, a **NoSQL** database, and complete an ETL pipeline using Python in this project. The data needs to be modeled by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries to complete the project. The initial part consists of extracting the CSV logs, modeling the data in Apache Cassandra, inserting the data, and finally querying the data to test the data model.
